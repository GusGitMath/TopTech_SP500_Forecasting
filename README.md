# Top Tech S&P 500 Forecasting

**Date:** November 2022

## Overview

Forecasting the stock market is inherently challenging. This project explores the relationship between Apple's stock price and other stocks in the S&P 500, particularly those in the technology sector. Through this analysis, I discovered that tech industry stocks can help predict trends in Apple's percentage price changes.

To model this relationship, I implemented a Vector Autoregression (VAR) model to forecast Apple's stock price for the next quarter. I then compared the performance of the VAR model against an ARIMA model to assess whether incorporating related stocks significantly improves forecasting accuracy.

## Data

Please note that the dataset provided here is a cleaned version, containing only the top ten tech stocks in the S&P 500 based on average trading volume. The original dataset, which includes a broader range of stocks, can be accessed through the following link:
